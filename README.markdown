The Complete Lojban Language
============================

This is a LaTeX version of John Cowan's [The Complete Lojban 
Language](http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=The+Lojban+Reference+Grammar&bl). 
I don't own the 
published version of the book, so this is based on the draft HTML 
version. Where possible, errors noted on the 
[Errata](http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=CLL%2C+aka+Reference+Grammar%2C+Errata) 
page for the book are corrected in this version. I've made an effort to 
typeset the tables and examples in a clearer way than in the HTML 
version; I've also replaced some tables with definition lists (and 
vice-versa).

The process of converting the HTML version of the book into LaTeX is 
very much still a work in progress, only a few chapters are complete.
